# Creating Our Own NASM Assembly Program

## Immediate Operand Sizes

**Decimal:**

```nasm
100
100d    ; explicitly decimal - d suffix
0100    ; still dec
```

**Hex:**

```nasm
0c8h    ; h suffix, leading zero required otherwise it's taken as var
0xc8    ; 0x prefix
0hc8    ; NASM is cool with 0h
```

**Octal:**

```nasm
300             ; octal - q suffix
0q310           ; 0q prefix
```

**Binary:**

```nasm
110010100b      ; b suffix
0b11001_0100    ; 0b prefix, underscores are allowed
```

## dx Instruction

* dx (x being replaced with size) is a pseudo-instruciton that declares size x that will be in memory when the program runs

### Sizes

* **db** = byte (1 bytes) or RESB
* **dw** = word (2 bytes) or RESW
* **dd** = dword (4 bytes) or RESD
* **dq** = qword (8 bytes) or RESQ
* **dt** = tword (10 bytes) or REST
* **do** = oword (16 bytes), RESO, DDQ, RESDQ
* **dy** = yword (32 bytes) or RESY
* **dz** = zword (64 bytes) or RESZ

### Reserve and Initialize Data

```nasm
db    0x40                          ; the byte 0x40 
db    0x40,0x41,0x42                ; three bytes in succession
db    'A',0x42                      ; char consts okay
db    'hello', 0x73, '$', 0x00      ; as are string consts
dw    0x1234                        ; 0x34 0x12
dw    'a'                           ; 0x61 0x00 (it's just a number)
dw    'ab'                          ; 0x61 0x62 (character constant)
dw    'abc'                         ; 0x61 0x62 0x63 0x00 (string)
dd    0x12345678                    ; 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12
dd    1.234567e20                   ; floating-point constant
dq    0x123456789abcdef0            ; eight byte constant
dq    1.234567e20                   ; double-precision float
dt    1.234567e20                   ; extended-precision float
```

#### You can also just reserve space without initializing it

```nasm
buff        resb    255     ; reserve 255 bytes
var1        resw    1       ; reserve a word
```

## Structure of a NASM program

* **Directives:**
    * There are two types of directives: *user-level* and *primitive*. 
    * Directives setup things such as processor mode, defining sections, lebels, externs, etc.
    * **BITS** : The `BITS` directives specifies the processor operating mode the code is designed to run on.
        * EX: `BITS 16, BITS 32, BITS 64`
    * **EXTERN** : Similar to C keyword `extern`. Declares a symbol which is not dfined in the module being assembled, but is assumed to be defined in some other module and needs to be refered to by this one. 
    * **GLOBAL** : Other end of `EXTERN`. Allows another module to extern the symbol. 
    * **SECTION** : Changes which section of the output file the code you write will be assembled into. 
* **Sections** 
    * Also called `SEGMENT`
    * Standard sections include:
        * `.text` : This is the actual code
        * `.data` : This is your data that's initialized to something other than zero at program startup
        * `.bss`  : Stores info about memory that needs to be zeroed at program startup. Like empty space and such. 
        * Many more sections... 

### Example

Let's create a hello world program!

* First, let's create our directives:

```nasm
bits 64
global _start

...
```

* Second, let's add our sections:

```nasm
bits 64
global _start

section .data

section .text
```

* Third, let's add our labels, we created a global _start:

```nasm
bits 64
global _start

section .data

section .text

_start:
```

* Next, let's create our data

```nasm
bits 64
global _start

section .data
    msg db      "hello, world!", 0xa ; 0xa = nl

section .text

_start:
...
```

* After we have our data created, let's populate code

```nasm
bits 64
global _start

section .data
    msg db      "hello, world!", 0xa

section .text

_start:

    mov rax, 1          ; 1 for sys_write 
    mov rdi, 1          ; 1 for fd 
    mov rsi, msg        ; move message into rsi
    mov rdx, 14         ; length of string
    syscall
    mov rax, 60         ; sys exit
    mov rdi, 0          ; error code (none) 
    syscall
```

## Using a C Library

* Remember the C Runtime we discussed? Remember how we said the C program does not actually start at `main`, but instead at `_start`, eventually calling `main`? If we keep that in mind, creating a NASM file that can use a C Library is easy. 
* Instead of `_start`, we are going to use `global main`. 
* We can extern any C Library functions we need, ex. `extern puts`
* Everything else is the same. 

```nasm
bits 64
global      main
extern      puts

section .text
main:
    mov rdi, message
    call puts
    ret

message:
    db      "Test!", 0
```


## Building/Compiling/Running

* **Without C Library:**
    * The only thing we need to do is compile nasm code into an object, then use the GNU linker to convert the object file into a executable. 
    * Parameters depend on OS and processor mode
        * Linux 64-bit:
            * Compile: `nasm -f elf64 file.nasm` or you can specify output `nasm -f elf64 file.nasm file.o`
            * Link: `ld file.o` or specify output with -o
            * Run: `./a.out`
        * Linux 32-bit:
            * Compile with elf32
        * Windows:
            * Compile with win32 or win64
            * Link with either link.exe or `ld` if you have MinGW installed
* **With C Library:**
    * The instructions are the same for compiling the nasm file into an object. But from there, we must use gcc to link the object with the C library. Linux 64bit example:

    `nasm -elf64 file.nasm && gcc file.o && ./a.out`
    
    * The command above is really three seperate commands seperated by `&&` signs... you can run each command individually if you desire. 
    * First we compile:
        * `nasm -elf64 file.nasm`
    * file.o is then ouputted...
    * Then we take file.o and compile/link it with gcc:
        * `gcc file.o`
    * Due to not specifying a output, the file `a.out` is created. 
    * Lastly, we can run the program:
        * `./a.out`

## Quick Calling Conventions Review

### Linux x86_64 

* Parameters are passed left to right into the following registers first, in order:
    * Int and pointers: `rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9`
    * For floating-point (float, double): `xmm0, xmm1, xmm2, xmm3, xmm4, xmm5, xmm6, xmm7`
* Additional is pushed on stack and are to be cleaned by the **caller** after the call
